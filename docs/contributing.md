# Contributing to SimKube

## Setting up your environment

### Prerequisites

In addition to the project prerequisites, you will need to have the following installed:

- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com)
- [golangci-lint](https://pre-commit.com)
- Nightly version of rustfmt

### Optional prerequisites

- [grcov](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov) (if you want to generate coverage reports locally)
- [controller-gen](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/controller-gen.html) (if you need to make changes to the
  Simulation CRD)
- [kopium](https://github.com/kube-rs/kopium) (if you need to make changes to the Simulation CRD)
- [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) (if you need to make changes to the SimKube API)
- [delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) (for debugging Golang code)
- [msgpack-tools](https://github.com/ludocode/msgpack-tools) (for inspecting the contents of exported trace files)

### Setup

Run `make setup` to install the pre-commit hooks and configure the Poetry virtualenv in `./k8s`

## Code organization

The SimKube repo is organized as follows:

```
/<root>
    /api       - OpenAPI v3 definitions for the SimKube API
    /build     - build scripts and helper functions (git submodule)
    /cli       - Golang code for the `skctl` CLI utility
    /cloudprov - Golang code for the `sk-cloudprov` Cluster Autoscaler cloud provider
    /ctrl      - Rust code for the `sk-ctrl` Kubernetes controller
    /docs      - Documentation
    /driver    - Rust code for the `sk-driver` Simulation runner
    /images    - Dockerfiles for all components
    /k8s       - ðŸ”¥Config Python scripts for Kubernetes manifest generation
    /lib
        /go    - shared Golang code
        /rust  - shared Rust code
    /tracer    - Rust code for the `sk-tracer` Kubernetes object
    /vnode     - Golang code for the Virtual-Kubelet-based virtual node
```

In general, code that is specific to a single artifact should go in the subdirectory for that artifact, but code that
needs to be shared between multiple artifacts should go in either `lib/go` or `lib/rust`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are planning to make changes to the API (either the Custom Resource Definition or the SimKube API), please read
> the [API changes](./api_changes.md) document first!

## Building and Deploying

### Building the artifacts

To build all SimKube artifacts for the first time run: 
- `git submodule init && git submodule update` 
- `make build` and `make skctl` from the root of this repository.

For all subsequent builds of SimKube artifacts, run only `make build` and `make skctl` from the root of this repository.

For all the components that run inside a Kubernetes cluster, you can simply run `make build`.  For minor technical
reasons, the CLI utility (`skctl`) is built separately: `make skctl`.  All build artifacts are placed in the `.build`
directory at the root of the repository.  If you just want to build a subset of the SimKube artifacts, you can set the
`ARTIFACTS` environment variable.  This will help limit compilation time if you are just working on a single or a few
components:

```
ARTIFACTS="sk-ctrl sk-driver" make build
```

By default, the Rust artifacts (`sk-ctrl`, `sk-driver`, and `sk-tracer`) are built inside Docker containers.  All the
intermediate compilation steps and the executables are saved in `.build/cargo`.  The Go artifacts (`skctl`,
`sk-cloudprov`, and `sk-vnode`) are built locally on your machine.

### Building docker images

As you are developing, if you need to deploy your artifacts to a Kubernetes cluster, you will need to build a Docker
image for them.  `make image` is a shorthand for this.  As before, if you just want to build images for a subset of
artifacts, you can limit the scope with the `ARTIFACTS` environment variable.  You can also point the build to your
docker registry by setting the `DOCKER_REGISTRY` environment variable; it defaults to `localhost:5000`.

To accomplish automatic updates of the changed artifacts in Kubernetes (see below), during the image build phase, images
are tagged with a SHA based on the contents of your Git repo (including working directory changes that have not been
committed yet, but _not_ including untracked files).  ðŸ”¥Config is smart enough to update the Deployment manifests with
the new SHA after every image build, which means that the artifacts that have changed will automatically be updated by
Kubernetes and everything else will be untouched.

One consequence of the above is that if you don't periodically clean up old built Docker images, you can fill up your
hard drive rather rapidly!  We recommend having `/var` (or wherever your Docker images live) be on a separate partition.
We'd like to improve this situation sometime in the future but it's a low priority right now.

The mechanism for determining the changes to your working directory temporarily resets your Git index to a different
location.  This is a little bit of a risky operation, although we think we've mostly worked the kinks out at this point.
We'd also like to make this better, but it's also a low priority.  You shouldn't lose any _data_, but it is possible
(though unlikely, unless you're doing something weird) that your index state gets corrupted.

### Running the artifacts in Kubernetes

All Kubernetes manifests are built using [ðŸ”¥Config](https://github.com/acrlabs/fireconfig), which is a thin wrapper
around [cdk8s](https://cdk8s.io).  To create the manifests and apply them to your Kubernetes cluster, do `make run`.
This will deploy changes to the cluster configured in your current KUBECONFIG.  You must have cluster admin privileges
on that cluster.

All generated Kubernetes manifests live in `.build/manifests`.  All manifests are generated every time (i.e., the
`ARTIFACTS` environment variable has no impact on this stage).  However, only the artifacts that have changed since the
last time you deployed will actually be updated in your cluster.

### Doing everything at once

As a convenience, you can run `make` or `make all` to run all three steps.  The `ARTIFACTS` and `DOCKER_REGISTRY`
environment variables will be respected for the steps where they make sense.

## Linting and running tests

### Testing your changes

Tests are divided into "unit tests" and "integration tests".  The distinction between these is fuzzy.  To run all the
tests, do `make test`.  If you'd just like to run the Golang tests, you can do `make test-go`, and if you just want to
run the Rust unit tests, you can do `make test-rust`.  To run the Rust integration tests, do `make itest-rust`.

### Linting your changes

Code linting rules are defined in `./golangci.yml` and `.rustfmt.toml` for Go and Rust code, respectively.  We also use
[clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/clippy/usage.html) for additional Rust linting and checks.  We use a _nightly_
version of rustfmt to take advantage of unstable formatting rules, so you will need to install a nightly toolchain here.
(Note that all actual Rust code does not use any nightly features).  You can run all lints with `make lint`.

### Code coverage

We don't require 100% test coverage for this project, and don't have a set threshold that is needed for tests.  However,
all functionality "of consequence" should be tested.  If you're writing a new feature and you think it's "of
consequence", please also write tests for them (see [Writing new tests](#writing-new-tests), below).

Code coverage is checked whenever you open a PR using [CodeCov](https://about.codecov.io).  It will leave a helpful
comment showing you coverage changes and provide a link to a dashboard with more detailed information about what is and
is not covered.

If you'd like to generate coverage reports locally, for Golang it is as simple as running `make cover-go`.  For Rust, it
is a little more complicated:

```
WITH_COVERAGE=1 RUST_COVER_TYPE=markdown make test-rust cover-rust
```

You will have to rebuild your binaries because generating coverage information is incompatible with incremental
builds.

### Writing new tests

There is a suite of utility functions for tests in `lib/(go|rust)/testutils` that provide additional fixtures and helper
functions for writing tests.  Feel free to add more utilities in here if it would be helpful.

Go tests live in `_test.go` files next to the source file they are testing.  Rust tests should in most cases be put into
a separate submodule called `tests` and included with a

```
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests;
```

block at the bottom of the main module.

In order to make `lib/rust/testutils` accessible outside the `lib/rust` crate, they are not included with
`#[cfg(test)]`, but instead with an optional `testutils` feature.

## Making a PR

Follow the standard process for opening a pull request.  Please provide a nice description of your contribution.  GitHub
actions will run tests, linting, and build.  If there are any errors there, please fix them!  Once your tests are
passing, one of the maintainers will sign off on the PR and merge it to master.
