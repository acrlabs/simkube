A record-and-replay simulation environment for the Kubernetes control plane based on [KWOK](https://kwok.sigs.k8s.io).

## Overview

This package provides the following components:

- `skctl`: a CLI utility for interacting with various other SimKube components
- `sk-ctrl`: a Kubernetes Controller that watches for Simulation custom resources and runs a simulation based on the
  provided trace file.
- `sk-driver`: the actual runner for a specific simulation, created as a Kubernetes Job by `sk-ctrl`
- `sk-tracer`: a watcher for Kubernetes pod creation and deletion events, saves these events in a replayable trace
  format.

## Installation

1. To install `sk-tracer` in your prod cluster: `kubectl apply -k k8s/kustomize/prod`
2. To install `sk-ctrl` in your simulation cluster: `kubectl apply -k k8s/kustomize/sim`
3. To install `skctl` on your dev machine: `cargo install skctl`
